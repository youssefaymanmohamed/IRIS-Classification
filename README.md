## Import Libraries <a id='import'>

In this section, we import the necessary libraries and modules for the project, including data analysis, visualization, and machine learning libraries.

## Data Collection and Statistical Analysis <a id='data-collection-and-statistical-analysis'>

Here, we load the dataset and provide a summary of the dataset, including statistical analysis. We also display a summary of the columns in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning <a id='data-cleaning'>

We check for null values in the dataset and handle duplicate records. Additionally, we inspect unique values in each column to ensure data quality.

## Data Visualization <a id='data-visualization'>

We use various visualizations to gain insights into the data. This includes histograms, density plots, and pair plots for different species of Iris flowers. Heatmaps are also used to show correlations between different features.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building machine learning models, we preprocess the data. This includes encoding the target variable using LabelEncoder and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Machine Learning Models <a id='ml-models'>

We build and evaluate different machine learning models for Iris flower classification, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

Hyperparameter tuning is performed for the Decision Tree model to improve its performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Iris flower classification using machine learning. You can explore each section for details and findings related to the dataset and models.

Feel free to use this code and analysis for your own projects or research.
